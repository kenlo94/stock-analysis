# Module 2 | Assignment - Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to refactor our existing code that we had written while working through the module. The code was written using the VBA editor in Microsoft Excel. Its intention is to analyze stock information that was presented to us in the excel file.

### Results

The results show the output of our refactored code for both the 2017 and 2018 Stock Analysis. If our refactored code was written correctly, the execution time should be faster since we have made our original code more efficient. Before refactoring my code, my execution times were about 0.7 seconds for both the 2017 and 2018 year. After the refactoring, my execution times went down to about 0.1 seconds each.

### Summary

An advantage that is obvious is the decrease in execution time. It also helps with the computer's memory usage because the refactored code will be cleaner and more efficient and can possibly take up less memory too. Pros of refactoring code include code that is more efficient and more organized. It can be written faster since we already know what we want our code to do. It may be beneficial for the workplace if we need someone else to take a look at our code since it will become less cluttered. Disadvantages of refactoring code can occur when a deadline is near and if you dont have time to test the refactored code because it may introduce bugs.
